I picked this article, which mainly introduces Web3, which is an emerging term that is used to describe the decentralized systems that help create cryptocurrencies or decentralized blockchains.
I don't personally invest in cryptocurrencies or NFTs, but I was curious about the technology behind the system. This article does not go into details about how a decentralized blockchain works or how to create one, but shares some insight on some general ideas behind the Web3 world.
Although it is deemed less sophisticated than some of the traditional databases, it might be a good thing to check out for many students who might be thinking about studying as it is an emerging industry with a lot of demand.
